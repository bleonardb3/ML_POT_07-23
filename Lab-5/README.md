# Lab-5 AutoAI + DevOps

## Introduction: 

This lab consists of two parts. The first part will demonstrate the new and exciting AutoAI capability to build and deploy an optimized model based on the Titanic data set. The second part will deploy a web application using the IBM Cloud DevOps toolchain that will invoke the deployed model to predict whether a passenger would have survived.

## Objectives: 

Upon completing the lab, you will:

1. Become familiar with the AutoAI capability
2. Automate the building of a machine learning model 
3. Save and deploy the model
4. Deploy a simple web front-end application and connect it to the deployed model using an IBM Cloud toolchain.
