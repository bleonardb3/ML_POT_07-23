## Hands-on Introduction to Machine Learning using Watson Studio

## Description:

Work with IBM's Watson Studio in this workshop to build, train, and test machine learning/deep learning models. Participants will be led through the following nine hands-on labs. Note, the first lab is a prerequisite for the other labs. Once Lab-1 is completed, the other labs can be done in any order.  

1. [Lab-1](Lab-1) - This lab will set up the environment for the subsequent labs. 
1. [Lab-2](Lab-2) - This lab will use a Jupyter Notebook and the XGBoost library to apply machine learning to a classification problem in the healthcare profession. The Watson Machine Learning API will then be used to save and deploy the model. 
1. [Lab-3](Lab-3) - This lab will demonstrate Watson Machine Learning capabilites to simplify the building and deployment of machine learning models. The ability to monitor and adjust the deployed model will be demonstrated via the continuous learning capability of Watson Studio. 
1. [Lab-4](Lab-4) - This lab will feature Watson OpenScale to demonstrate bias detection, bias mitigation and explainability of algorihms. The instructor will demo this capability.  
1. [Lab-5](Lab-5) - This lab will feature the Watson Studio Neural Network modeler, and Experiment Assistant to build, train, and test a Convolutional Neural Network to classify images of handwritten digits.  
1. [Lab-6](Lab-6) - This lab will feature the Watson Studio SPSS modeler to demonstrate visual drag and drop creation of a machine learning model. 
1. [Lab-7](Lab-7) - This lab will feature the Watson Studio Data Refinery to demonstrate data profiling, visualization, and data preparation. 
1. [Lab-8](Lab-8) - This lab will demonstrate Watson Machine Learning deployment of a Machine Learning model, and DevOps to build an application that invokes the deployed model.
