# Lab-8: Introduction to Watson Visual Recognition Service 

## Introduction:

IBM Watson provides APIs and Services for discovery, natural language understanding, visual recognition, speech to text, text to speech, language translation, natural language classification, personality insights and tone analysis.  Two of these capabilities are currently integrated with Watson Studio, (1) the Visual Recognition service, and (2) the Natural Language Classification service. This lab will focus on the Visual Recognition service integration with Watson Studio. 

## Objectives:

The goal of the lab is to gain familiarity with the features of the Watson Visual Recognition service integration with Watson Studio. Upon completing the lab, you will know how to:

1.	Create a Watson Visual Recognition service
2.	Associate the service with a project
3.  Create visual recognition classes
4.  Associate files of images with these classes. 
5.  Train the visual recognition model
6.  Test the model.
